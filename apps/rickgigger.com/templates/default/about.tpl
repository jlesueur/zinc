<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>As you might be able to tell I am a computer programmer and not a graphic designer or for that matter an artist of any kind.</p>

<h3>About This Site</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>
	The layout for this site is based on <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup">this 
	excellent article</a> written by Meagan Fisher for <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org">24ways.org</a>.  It's a good article.  
	It breaks down the design process very well and is helpful even
	if you only have a cursory knowledge of HTML.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the site at various stages of css development as prescribed by the article.  Each new stage is accomplished by only making
	changes to the css, keeping the markup display agnostic.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/1">Stage 1 - Raw Markup</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/2">Stage 2 - Basic Layout</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/3">Stage 3 - Colors</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/4">Stage 4 - Fonts</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about">Stage 5 - Polish (drop shadows, background texture)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	One of my goals in making this is to gain a greater mastery separating presentation entirely from content using 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a> so I can make fewer round trips to the graphics designer 
	when creating web based software.  So far it's going rather well.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of the article I decided to try <a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/alt1">an alternate look.</a></p>
<p>
	When I want to get real work done though I go with 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.giannifavaretto.com/">this guy</a>.  He's a great designer and great to work with.
