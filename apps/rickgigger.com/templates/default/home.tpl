<h3>Another attempt at a personal website</h3>
<h4>Mar 15, 2010</h4>
<p>
	I have decided to make a personal website (again).  In the past I usually started because I wanted to try 
	out a <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/">new</a> 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">tool</a> 
	or <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">service</a> for making web content.  I usually ended up hating the tool
	or service and giving up on maintaining the site.  This time I am coding it by hand and using it as an experiment to whip my html/css
	skills into shape.  I also plan on using it to showcase <a target="_new" href="http://code.google.com/p/zoop/">my OSS project</a>
	which I am using for everything on this site.
</p>
<p>These are the only other tools that I plan on using:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_new" href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a></li>
	<li><a target="_new" href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>About This Site</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>
	The layout for this site is based on <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup">this 
	excellent article</a> written by Meagan Fisher for <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org">24ways.org</a>.  It's a good article.  
	It breaks down the design process very well and is helpful even
	if you only have a cursory knowledge of HTML.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the site at various stages of css development as prescribed by the article.  Each new stage is accomplished by only making
	changes to the css, keeping the markup display agnostic.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/1">Stage 1 - Raw Markup</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/2">Stage 2 - Basic Layout</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/3">Stage 3 - Colors</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/4">Stage 4 - Fonts</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about">Stage 5 - Polish (drop shadows, background texture)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	One of my goals in making this is to gain a greater mastery separating presentation entirely from content using 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a> so I can make fewer round trips to the graphics designer 
	when creating web based software.  So far it's going rather well.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of the article I decided to try <a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/alt1">an alternate look.</a></p>
<p>
	When I want to get real work done though I go with 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.giannifavaretto.com/">this guy</a>.  He's a great designer and great to work with.
