	<h3>Dinosaur Comics</h3>
	<h4>Mar 17, 2010 - <a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php">I want to go to there</a></h4>
	<p>
		This is by far my favorite web comic.  <a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php">Dinosaur comics</a> is written 
		by <a target="_new" href="http://twitter.com/ryanqnorth">Ryan North</a>.  
		It is a <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_comics">constrained webcomic</a>.  The pictures are
		the same every time and only the dialog changes.  Sometimes additional artwork is added to the exising template.  
		Here is an example:
	</p>
	<center>
		<img width="400" src="http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-1450.png">
	</center>
	<p>
		Here are some gems.  If these don't get you into, dinosaur comics I don't know what will.
	</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1560">
				People who say "Always be true to yourself" fail to consider that there are completely unrepentant murderers.
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1554">
				Maybe it's a good idea that people don't live forever.  Rhetorical people, I mean!
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=740">
				It's these positive benefits of having friends that concern me!
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1423">
				Poems likely predate the written word!
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=556">
				I think I'm becoming racist against taxi drivers!
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=14">
				I believe this is called nihilism.
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=530">
				What is second base?  Nobody actually knows what it represents!
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a target="_new" href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=463">
				I'm tired of movies and plays and radio dramas in which all of the characters have such
				snappy dialogs.
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Ok, so maybe Dinosaur Comics isn't for everyone.  If you are like me though then you found the above to be pretty 
		awesome.  My favorite quote on the entire site though is on the about page under the heading "About Interacting Socially"
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		This can be tricky! You want to be friendly, but you don't want to come on too strong. My best advice is to carefully 
		observe others, and to relax!
	</blockquote>
	<p>Good advice for any real geek.</p>

	<h3>Another attempt at a personal website</h3>
	<h4>Mar 15, 2010</h4>
	<p>
		I have decided to make a personal website (again).  In the past I usually started because I wanted to try 
		out a <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/">new</a> 
		<a target="_new" href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">tool</a> 
		or <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">service</a> for making web content.  I usually ended up hating the tool
		or service and giving up on maintaining the site.  This time I am coding it by hand and using it as an experiment to whip my html/css
		skills into shape.  I also plan on using it to showcase <a target="_new" href="http://code.google.com/p/zoop/">my OSS project</a>
		which I am using for everything on this site.
	</p>
	<p>These are the only other tools that I plan on using:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_new" href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a></li>
		<li><a target="_new" href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a></li>

<h3>About This Site</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>
	The layout for this site is based on <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup">this 
	excellent article</a> written by Meagan Fisher for <a target="_new" href="http://24ways.org">24ways.org</a>.  It's a good article.  
	It breaks down the design process very well and is helpful even
	if you only have a cursory knowledge of HTML.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the site at various stages of css development as prescribed by the article.  Each new stage is accomplished by only making
	changes to the css, keeping the markup display agnostic.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/1">Stage 1 - Raw Markup</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/2">Stage 2 - Basic Layout</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/3">Stage 3 - Colors</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/4">Stage 4 - Fonts</a></li>
	<li><a href="{$scriptUrl}/about">Stage 5 - Polish (drop shadows, background texture)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	One of my goals in making this is to gain a greater mastery separating presentation entirely from content using 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a> so I can make fewer round trips to the graphics designer 
	when creating web based software.  So far it's going rather well.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of the article I decided to try <a href="{$scriptUrl}/about/alt1">an alternate look.</a></p>
<p>
	When I want to get real work done though I go with 
	<a target="_new" href="http://www.giannifavaretto.com/">this guy</a>.  He's a great designer and great to work with.
</p>
